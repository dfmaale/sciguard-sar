# Statistical Assurance Regions

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.23228565.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23228565)

Statistical Assurance Regions (SARs) identify the prespecified deployment environments in
which a frozen predictive pipeline remains below a risk tolerance. **SciGuard** is the
reference Python implementation and reproducibility workflow accompanying the JMLR study.

Open **`SciGuard_JMLR_Reproducible_Analysis_MIMIC_IV.ipynb`** after cloning or downloading the entire repository.
It is the sole current notebook. The manuscript is `manuscript/main_jmlr.tex` and its compiled PDF.

This revision unifies the notebook and package, corrects missingness generation, adds exact
finite-sample comparisons, quantifies reference-risk uncertainty, and replaces the empirical
claims with a fresh full run. The multiplier band is asymptotic and undercovers in some tested
regimes. MIMIC-IV v3.1 has now been executed on credentialed local data; only aggregate benchmark outputs, the frozen protocol, and source-file hashes are included.

## Install and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfmaale/sciguard-sar.git
cd sciguard-sar
python -m pip install -e ".[experiments,notebook]"
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/run_analysis.py --profile smoke
```

The synthetic and WDBC analyses above do not require MIMIC-IV. A complete re-execution of
the canonical notebook, including its MIMIC-IV sections, requires credentialed local data:

```bash
SCIGUARD_RUN_MIMIC=1 MIMIC_IV_PATH=/path/to/mimic-iv python scripts/execute_notebook.py
```

This command executes the full canonical notebook in a fresh in-process IPython shell,
captures its outputs, and exports manuscript tables. It does not need kernel sockets.
For a conventional Jupyter kernel, use `python scripts/execute_notebook.py --backend jupyter`,
or open the notebook in JupyterLab and choose Restart Kernel and Run All Cells. The delivered
execution metadata states which backend was used.

For a quick notebook run, set `SCIGUARD_PROFILE=smoke`. On Windows, a convenient first-cell
setting is `os.environ['SCIGUARD_PROFILE'] = 'smoke'` **before** the PROFILE assignment.
The default is `full`. Full and smoke outputs are separate. Results are recomputed, never
silently read from the old archive. The full run can take several minutes.

For non-notebook reproduction:

```bash
python scripts/run_analysis.py --profile full
python scripts/render_results.py
python scripts/export_manuscript.py
```

Compile the manuscript from its directory with `latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode main_jmlr.tex`.
The official style file supplied in the original archive is retained. Main tables and numeric
macros are generated from current full-run CSVs; do not hand-edit the generated tables.

## MIMIC-IV

1. Keep your credentialed dataset locally; this archive does not download or contain it.
2. `config/mimic_protocol.json` now contains the frozen v3.1 benchmark settings used for the
   completed run, including the operational 0--1-risk tolerance and prospective rationale.
   Change these settings only for a clearly identified new analysis.
3. Set `MIMIC_IV_PATH` to the directory containing `hosp/patients.csv(.gz)` and
   `hosp/admissions.csv(.gz)` (older `core/` layout is also supported).
4. Set `SCIGUARD_RUN_MIMIC=1` and run the notebook, or use:

```bash
python scripts/run_mimic.py --data /path/to/mimic-iv --config config/mimic_protocol.json
```

The completed credentialed run is stored under `results/mimic_local/` and its decision map
under `figures/mimic_local/`. The temporal protocol aligns each admission to its anchor year,
excludes ambiguous source/deployment overlap, and reports approximate admission intervals.
It includes native missingness, class-imbalance diagnostics, an always-survive baseline, and
one simultaneous family across models/domains/missingness. Patient-level MIMIC-IV data are
not redistributed.

The reviewer-requested secondary specification evaluates false-negative risk with
`tau_fn = 0.20`, equivalent to requiring sensitivity of at least 0.80. Under the primary exact
Clopper-Pearson Bonferroni procedure, 3 of 60 eligible conditions were certified; all three
were histogram-gradient-boosting conditions.

The standalone notebook download still needs this repository's `src/`, `data/`, and `scripts/`
folders to rerun. Clone or download the complete repository. Restricted clinical data,
patient-level derivatives, and trained clinical models are not included.

To rebuild the response PDFs and audit the final artifacts, install the `reports` extra,
then run `python scripts/build_revision_report.py`, `python scripts/build_final_review_response.py`,
and `python scripts/verify_artifacts.py`.
The response PDF renderer uses DejaVu fonts at `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu`;
adjust that path on other systems. Manuscript compilation requires LaTeX and latexmk.
